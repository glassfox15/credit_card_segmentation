# Credit Card User Segmentation With Machine Learning Techniques (Math 156)
### by Jacob Titcomb

* This repository is the final project for Mathematics 156 (Machine Learning) at UCLA with Professor Jona Lelmi, for Fall 2023.
* Though I led the work and direction of this project, my group members (listed on the cover page of the PDF) contributed significantly as well. Thus this truly was a group undertaking.
* The course itself, Math 156, covered a variety of topics in machine learning, approaching them with mathematical rigor. Our project focused on applying those concepts: implementing clustering techniques.
  + ML techniques in particular:
    + PCA
    + Spectral Clustering
    + Gaussian Mixture Model
    + Hierarchical Clustering
    + K-Means Clustering
* All our work is described in depth in the PDF, our report.
* The data were sourced from Kaggle (link in the report).
